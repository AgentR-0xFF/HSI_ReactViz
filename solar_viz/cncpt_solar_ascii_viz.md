# Solar ASCII Visualization Project

## Project Overview
This project is an interactive Solar ASCII visualization tool developed in React, designed to illustrate the solar position and twilight phases throughout the day. It provides a visual representation of astronomical, nautical, civil, and visible horizons based on the user's location, time of day, and day of the year.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Solar Positioning:** Calculates solar altitude, azimuth, and daylight hours.
- **Twilight Zone Representation:** Displays transitions between astronomical, nautical, and civil twilight phases.
- **Customizable User Input:** Users can adjust latitude, time, and day of the year to observe changes in solar positioning.
- **Real-time Animation:** Includes time controls for play, pause, and fast-forward features.
- **Intuitive UI:** Utilizes sliders and buttons for seamless interaction.

## Technical Details
- **Framework:** Built with React and modern JavaScript.
- **UI Components:** Incorporates reusable components for sliders, buttons, and visual cards.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for browser-based deployment with GitHub Pages.

## Deployment
The project can be deployed using GitHub Pages:
1. Install dependencies and build the React app.
2. Push the code to a GitHub repository.
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages using `gh-pages` npm package.
